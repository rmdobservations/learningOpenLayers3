# Learning OpenLayers 3

## Synopsis

Many of the examples for Openlayers 3 have out-dated functions (those that were tried but not accepted). This project consists of programs which I have working on my home server.

## Code Example

It should be possible to download this code and run it on a local server. 

## Motivation

I am learning OpenLayers 3 and correcting many misunderstandings I find in the code. I am trying to give back to the community which has provided this software and help more people to learn and use it. 

## Installation

Download code and test on local server.

### Software Versions

```markdown
- OpenLayers 3 Version: v4.0.1
- ol3-layerswitcher working with OL3 v4.0.1
- jQuery v3.1.1 | (c) jQuery Foundation
```

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

I test my code on a local Apache server.
